1.Exception handeling
Exception handling is a mechanism in programming used to manage errors and other exceptional events that occur during the execution of a program. It allows a program to continue running or gracefully shut down instead of crashing when an unexpected situation arises.

Key Concepts in Exception Handling:
Exceptions:

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Examples include attempting to divide by zero, trying to access a file that doesn’t exist, or running out of memory.
Different programming languages have their own built-in exceptions, but you can also define your own custom exceptions.
Try-Except Block:

Try Block: Code that might raise an exception is placed inside a try block.
Except Block: If an exception occurs, the flow of control is immediately transferred to the except block, where you can handle the error appropriately.
Example in Python:

python
Copy code
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
Finally Block:

A finally block can be used after the try and except blocks to define code that will run no matter what, whether an exception occurs or not. It’s typically used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.
Example:

python
Copy code
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found.")
finally:
    file.close()
Raising Exceptions:

You can also explicitly raise an exception using the raise keyword in many programming languages. This can be useful if you want to enforce certain conditions in your code.
Example:

python
Copy code
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 18:
    raise ValueError("Age must be at least 18.")
Catching Multiple Exceptions:

You can catch multiple types of exceptions by specifying them in the except clause.
Example:

python
Copy code
try:
    result = 10 / int(input("Enter a number: "))
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
Custom Exceptions:

You can create your own exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the base Exception class.
Example:

python
Copy code
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error.")
except CustomError as e:
    print(e)
Why Exception Handling is Important:
Error Management: Prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly and allows for proper handling of errors.
Cleaner Code: Keeps your code cleaner by separating error-handling logic from the main logic.
Resource Management: Ensures that resources like files, network connections, and memory are properly managed and released even in the event of an error.
User Experience: Provides meaningful feedback to users when something goes wrong, rather than just crashing or providing an unclear error message.
